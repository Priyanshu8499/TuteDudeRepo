# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
# o	Subtraction
# o	Multiplication
# o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
add = a + b
sub = a - b
mul = a * b
div = a / b

print(f"Addition: {add}")
print(f"Substraction:{sub}")
print(f"Multiplication: {mul}")
print(f"Division: {div}")
